A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/chinchang/pen/lICaq.

This an attempt to make a mini tooltip library in pure CSS. Does the basic job but still has bugs and lacks some important features.
Will try improving this into some usable thing.

Note: Works best on Firefox (transitions on pseudo elements not supported on any other browser #sad).
