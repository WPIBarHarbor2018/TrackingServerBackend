Custom Elements
~~~

Each element should have a CSS file named style.css to serve as the main CSS
file for the element. Additionally, a JavaScript file script.js must be
included. If there is no JavaScript code or no CSS markup, leave the file empty.
If you do not create the file at all, there will be a background 404 when the
browser attempts to load the resource. This won't detract from user experience
but is undesired. We don't want to allow errors just because no one will notice.
